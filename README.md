COVID-mobility-and-behavior
==============================

This is a code and analysis repository for the paper "Cell phone tracking data reveals heterogeneity in stay at
home behavior during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic". We analyze Safegraph COVID stay-at-home behavior data using nonlinear 
dimensionality reduction techniques and clustering. We produce lower-dimensional embeddings that capture the stay-at-home
behavioral patterns that correlate with socioeconomic information (e.g. income). Using the lower-dimensional embeddings, 
we obtain geographically connected clusters which reveal differences in stay-at-home behavior between rural and urban areas. 
The results are consistent across multiple states.
